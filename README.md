Project Description

Real Trust is a full-stack web application designed to showcase a professional consulting company’s services, projects, and client feedback through a modern and responsive landing page. The application includes a dynamic Admin Panel that allows administrators to add projects and client testimonials, which are instantly reflected on the landing page without modifying the front-end code.

The project demonstrates the integration of frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with a Node.js + Express backend, using JSON-based data storage to manage dynamic content efficiently.
